==============
scripts to use in the CMS to pull existing content 
Examples:
http://www.t4dev.vcu.edu/biology/people/  - pulls content from bio pages
http://www.t4dev.vcu.edu/biology/events/ - pulls from event pages

To create dynamic content in the CMS you need to create:
2 Content Types (1 type for the script, the other type will have two types in one)
2-3 Navigation objects depending on how many places you want to render the content

Navigation objects to use = Publish to One File
